#Using create_yum_image

Assuming you have a yum repo enabled. This creates a directory 
/tftpboot/images/compute and installs the rpms that are part of Base and 
Desktop YUM groups.

{{{

}}}

This creates a directory /tftpboot/images/compute that will install bash, 
kernel, grub and any dependencies they may have

{{{
create_yum_image -i compute -r kernel grub bash
}}}

This creates a directory /tftpboot/images/compute that will install the rpms you have installed on your running box

{{{
create_yum_image -i compute -r ` rpm -qa --queryformat "%{name}\n" |paste -s -d ' '`
